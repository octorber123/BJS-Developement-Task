## Things i will improve:
#### Code
- currently carousel is not resposive, as no bootstrap responsive methods have been used 
- code needs to be refactored to replace divs with appropriate tags, this is to allow the browser to understand the webpage during compiling.
- need to use rem and percentage instead of px in CSS to improve responsive design

- Havent put an indicator to inform the viewer the slide they are viewing
