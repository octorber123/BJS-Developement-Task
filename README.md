# BJS-Developement-Task  

## Use
- please clone this project and open it locally, an attempt was made to put it on heroku but for some reason the animations stopped working

## Functionality:
- shows a working slide carousel
- the work is very similar to the example
- adequet comments, indentation and followed good practises (the ones i knew) in html and css file to improve code readibility.
- carousel can be navigated by arrows or the nav bar
- when the user hovers and clicks on the carousel nav bar it is highlighted 
- when the user hovers over the slide navigation arrows its background is highlighted 
- had to remove white background from image 2 so that i could blend it into slide 2 background colour

## Technologies:
- Languages : HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap5

## Struggles
- I added a gradient to the background in slide 4 so that the image could blend into the background, but i coudlnt recreate the example. I also tried adding the gradient to the image, but with no luck :(
- when user hovers over carousel navigation arrows the background changes. i couldnt recreate the example given

## Errors
- imported and applied Evelen clean and Gotham book, but didnt look the same as example - i tried many times
- on slide 3 i was unable to streach the image to fill the slide container, i think its beucase of the 100% width of the image container.

## Things i missed/ need to be improved:
#### Code
- carousel is not resposive, since no bootstrap responsive methods have been used
- realised later that i only used divs - bad for browser as it doent know what the div has
- used px instead or rem or percentages - bad for responsiveness
- didnt get time to use js to make animated carousel arrows
#### Design
- no shadow added to carousel nav bar
- not added nav bar lines 
- only simple animation on slide transition
- havent put an indicator to highlight the slide the user is viewing
- all bullet points are the same colour
