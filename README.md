## Use
- please clone this project and open it locally, an attempt was made to put it on heroku but for some reason the animations stopped working

## Technologies:
- Languages : HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap5

## Functionality:
- shows a working slide carousel
- the work is very similar to the example given
- adequet comments, indentation and followed good practises (the ones i knew) in html and css file to improve code readibility.
- carousel can be navigated by arrows or the nav bar
- when the user hovers and clicks on the carousel nav bar it is highlighted 
- when the user hovers over the slide navigation arrows its background is highlighted 
- [side note] had to remove the white background from the image for slide 2, it had to be done so it could blend into the background colour
